1) On viewing the main page, you are prompted for three difficulties.
  A) Easy: 8x8 board with 10 mines
  B) Medium: 16x16 board with 40 mines
  C) Hard: 22x22 board with 99 mines
  
 2) After selecting a difficulty, you'll be presented with a square board with a menu bar underneath, with the following components:
    A) Mine and Marking count: The total amount of mines is kept on screen, along with the amount of tiles marked.
    B) Quick Restart: At any time, the quick restart button can be pressed to reset the board.
    C) Change Difficulty: The difficulty can be changed by pressing this button.
    D) Toggle Sound: If the sounds aren't to the player's interest, they can be muted.
    
 3) To win the game, the player will have to 'uncover' all the spaces that do not have mines. To uncover a space, the player must left click a space to uncover it. An uncovered space will either have a mine or a number. If a mine is uncovered, the player loses. If they've clicked a number, the space will show the number of mines in the 8 spaces around it. If there are no mines around it, the space will reveal all spaces touching it and the spaces touching those, and so on, until spaces touching mines are revealed.
 
 4) The player can mark spaces using the right click.
